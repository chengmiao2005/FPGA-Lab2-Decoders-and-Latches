# Validation record

Date: 5 September 2026.

## Completed checks

Static SystemVerilog compilation/elaboration with `pyslang 11.0.0`, an explicit top module, and default time scale `1ns/1ps`:

| Top module | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `tb_decoder_case_a1` | Passed |
| `tb_decoder_case_a2` | Passed |
| `tb_decoder_case_b1` | Passed |
| `tb_decoder_case_b2` | Passed |
| `tb_decoder_case_c1` | Passed |
| `tb_decoder_case_c2` | Passed |

The launcher scripts were also checked with `bash -n` where present.

## Scope

This compiles/elaborates the listed Verilog sources. It does not run behavioral simulation or prove output correctness. Existing testbenches remain observational or retain their original assertions. Icarus/Verilator execution, C++/OpenGL builds, FPGA synthesis, and board operation were not run in this environment.

The README documents dependencies and commands for the next execution check.
